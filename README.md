# The_little_game_engine_that_could_website
This is a website requirement for the final project of CS5850, Building Game Engines.

## Website Requirements

This simple HTML page was created as a requirement for CS5850, Building Game Engines, at Northeastern University. The requirements are listed below. The website is hosted via Github pages, and was used to introduce our final project under the team name "The Little Game Engine That Could". The finished project included a game engine, created in C++, a finished game, gravity_guy.py created as a Python script, a a tile-map editor, created in Python Tkinter, as well as other versions of the game and various charts and documentation pages. Click the link at the bottom of the page to view the finished website, which includes a video highlighting the features of the game engine we created.

The following were the requirements for a 1-page .html page.

1. Provide a 1 minute video trailer followed by at least 3 screenshots of your game (order matters, video first, then screenshots below)
2. Your documentation (i.e. a link to your doxygen generated files)
3. **An image** of your engine architecture.
4. A link to your binary
5. A short post mortem (i.e. A few paragraphs describing how you would take the project further, what went well, and what you would change if given another month on the project) should be put together on a 1-page .html page.
