# The_little_game_engine_that_could_website
This is a website requirement for the final project of CS5850, Building Game Engines.

## Website Requirements

I think it is incredibly important to build a portfolio of your game development works! You will be building a 1 page website(it can be all html) to market your assignment. You can re-use this template for your next project, and potentially other personal projects.

The following are the requirements for a 1-page .html page.

1. Provide a 1 minute video trailer followed by at least 3 screenshots of your game (order matters, video first, then screenshots below)
2. Your documentation (i.e. a link to your doxygen generated files)
3. **An image** of your engine architecture.
4. A link to your binary
5. A short post mortem (i.e. A few paragraphs describing how you would take the project further, what went well, and what you would change if given another month on the project) should be put together on a 1-page .html page. 

This website will be the first place I look to grab your project files and binaries.
