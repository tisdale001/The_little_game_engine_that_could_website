                If we had eight more weeks to work on this project, there are many things that we would like to work on. 
                There were extra features that we just got started on, such as rewinding replays of our game, and the procedural 
                generation of levels. Procedural generation would be a great feature for a “runner” game like Gravity Guy, where 
                the gameplay can be almost infinite. One of our group members got a good start on this feature, but we would
                definitely have liked to have dived into this feature more fully.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px">
                The main feature that we didn’t prove in our demo game, was the ability to introduce “enemy” game objects, mainly 
                because Gravity Guy doesn’t rely on enemies to destroy or avoid. The original game is more of an obstacle course and 
                a race against time. We coded the ability to add many GameObjects, of course, but the handling of them would be in the 
                Python game logic. It just wasn’t necessary for the game we chose to demonstrate. During the first week of our extra time, 
                we could easily create another (possibly side-scroller) game to feature this ability. Spatial partitioning would be another 
                ability to quickly demonstrate in a game with many GameObjects. We would have liked to have created a game that required this.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px">
                Finally, we agree as a team that the use of python tkinter for our editor was a design flaw. We made a choice to 
                start the project with tkinter because we wanted to get up and running as quickly as possible, so that we would have 
                time to begin on the actual game creation and finish all the requirements of the project. Tkinter is slow and 
                cumbersome. We could build a much better, and more professional, GUI from C++ libraries, and it would then be possible 
                to link the editor with the engine and the scripting logic to add the feature of being able to play the level as you 
                build it. If we had another eight weeks, we agree that we would start from scratch and build the editor in C++.
